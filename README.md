# Education and Employment Analytics

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze factors influencing educational choices and employment outcomes among students. We explore questions such as whether gender influences choice of educational streams and if salary affects job preferences.

## Stages of Analytics

### Ask
In the "Ask" phase, we formulated key questions to guide our analysis:
- What factors influence categories of education, such as choice of educational streams?
- Does gender play a significant role in selecting educational streams?
- How does salary affect job preferences among students?

### Prepare
In the "Prepare" phase, we acquired a dataset from Kaggle to address these questions. Despite its limited size, we assumed the dataset to be sufficiently accurate for our analytical purposes. This dataset formed the foundation for our exploration and analysis of educational and employment trends.
