# Placement-Insights-Unveiling-Trends-in-Student-Career-Trajectories
"Analyzing student placement data at XYZ Campus to uncover trends and factors influencing career outcomes. Utilizing descriptive and predictive analytics techniques to provide insights for students, educators, and recruiters.


# Education and Employment Analytics

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze factors influencing educational choices and employment outcomes among students. We explore questions such as whether gender influences choice of educational streams and if salary affects job preferences.

## Stages of Analytics

### Ask
In the "Ask" phase, we formulated key questions to guide our analysis:
- What factors influence categories of education, such as choice of educational streams?
- Does gender play a significant role in selecting educational streams?
- How does salary affect job preferences among students?

### Prepare
In the "Prepare" phase, we acquired a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement) to address these questions. Despite its limited size, we assumed the dataset to be sufficiently accurate for our analytical purposes. This dataset formed the foundation for our exploration and analysis of educational and employment trends.


### Process
In the "Process" phase, we thoroughly examined the dataset for cleanliness and consistency. We checked for null values and duplications and found that there were no null values except in the 'salary' column. Although the 'salary' column had a considerable percentage of null values, removing these rows would significantly impact our analysis. Therefore, we decided to retain the rows with null values in the 'salary' column, as the remaining columns were free of nulls. Overall, we concluded that the dataset was mostly cleaned and suitable for analysis.
